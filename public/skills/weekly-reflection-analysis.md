# Weekly Reflection Analysis — Reference for Forge AI Coach

Use this when analyzing a user's weekly reflection to generate insights. Focus on actionable patterns, not generic encouragement.

## Analysis Framework

For each reflection, evaluate across these dimensions:

### 1. Engagement Score (How active were they?)
- **High (4-5 tools tried, built something):** "You crushed it this week." Suggest a more ambitious project.
- **Medium (2-3 tools tried, explored but didn't build):** "Solid exploration week." Suggest one specific quick win.
- **Low (0-1 tools tried):** "No pressure — let's find one tool that actually fits your week." Simplify.

### 2. Tool-User Fit (Are they using the right tools?)
Check for mismatches:
- Beginner using Advanced tools → suggest stepping stone tools
- Advanced user on Beginner tools → they might be bored, suggest something more powerful
- Paying for tools they rarely use → flag it gently
- Ignoring free tools that fit their needs → highlight them

### 3. Learning Trajectory (Are they progressing?)
Compare this week to previous weeks:
- Trying new categories → exploring phase, keep variety
- Going deeper in one category → specializing, support it
- Repeating same tools without building → stuck, needs a project push
- Building more each week → great trajectory, acknowledge it

### 4. Preference Signals (What do they actually want?)
Extract from their reflection language:
- "It was fast" / "Easy to use" → values speed and simplicity
- "I could customize everything" → values control and depth
- "The free tier was enough" → price-sensitive
- "I shared it with my team" → social/collaborative motivation
- "I didn't have time" → needs shorter projects (30 min max)
- "I wasn't sure what to make" → needs project briefs, not tool lists

## Insight Template

Generate insights in this format (keep it to 3-4 sentences):

```
[Specific observation about this week]. [Pattern or trend if visible].
[One actionable suggestion for next week]. [Encouragement tied to something concrete they did].
```

Example: "You gravitated toward video tools again — AKOOL and RecCloud both clicked for you. That's two weeks in a row, so video content might be your sweet spot. Next week, try combining them: record in RecCloud, edit in Descript, and add an AI avatar intro with AKOOL. You'd have a full content pipeline."

Bad example: "Great job this week! You're making wonderful progress. Keep exploring and trying new things!" (Too generic, says nothing specific.)

## Next Week Adjustments

Based on the analysis, adjust recommendations:

| This week's signal | Next week's action |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Loved a specific tool | Include it again + suggest its "power feature" |
| Struggled with a tool | Replace with easier alternative in same category |
| Built something | Suggest a follow-up project that levels up |
| Didn't build anything | Assign one 30-min quick win with clear deliverable |
| Mentioned a new interest | Add one tool from that category |
| Complained about pricing | Swap paid tools for free alternatives |
| Asked about a tool not in their list | Add it to next week if relevant |
