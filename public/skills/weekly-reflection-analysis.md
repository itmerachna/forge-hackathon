# Weekly Reflection Analysis

## Overview
After you complete your weekly reflection, Forge's AI analyzes your responses to generate personalized insights, track patterns over time, and improve future recommendations.

## What Gets Analyzed

### Tool Engagement Patterns
- Which tools did you spend the most time with?
- Did free or paid tools resonate more?
- Are you gravitating toward a specific category?

### Skill Progression Signals
- Are you moving from beginner tools to intermediate ones?
- Which tool features are you using (basic vs. advanced)?
- How quickly are you getting comfortable with new tools?

### Motivation & Blockers
- What energizes you about certain tools?
- Common blockers: time, complexity, cost, relevance
- How does your mood correlate with tool adoption?

## How Insights Are Generated
1. **Pattern Matching**: Compare this week's reflection with previous weeks
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Gauge enthusiasm vs. frustration levels
3. **Goal Alignment**: Check if explored tools align with your 4-week goal
4. **Recommendation Tuning**: Adjust next week's suggestions based on what worked

## Output
After analysis, Forge updates your learning profile with:
- **Strengths**: Tools and categories where you're thriving
- **Growth Areas**: Skills or tool types to push further on
- **Adjusted Recommendations**: Next week's tools tuned to your trajectory
- **Encouragement**: Specific wins to celebrate from the week

## Memory Update
