# Tool Discovery

## Overview
Forge curates weekly AI tool recommendations personalized to your focus area, skill level, and goals. Each week, you'll receive a fresh set of tools to explore.

## How It Works
1. **Weekly Curation**: Every Monday, Forge selects 10 AI tools based on your profile
2. **Smart Matching**: Tools are matched to your skill level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
3. **Category Alignment**: Recommendations align with your focus area (design, development, etc.)
4. **Progress Tracking**: Mark tools as "Trying" or "Tried" to track your journey

## Getting the Most Out of Tool Discovery
- **Try at least 2-3 tools per week** to build momentum
- **Spend 15-30 minutes** with each new tool before deciding
