## How to Recommend

1. Ask what they're trying to create, not what category they're interested in
2. Suggest ONE tool first, not a list. Be opinionated.
3. Give them the quick test so they can evaluate in 5 minutes
4. Mention a specific project they could build (reference project-ideation.md)
5. Only suggest alternatives if they push back or the first suggestion doesn't fit
