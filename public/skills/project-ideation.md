# Project Ideation

## Overview
The best way to learn a new AI tool is to use it on a real project. Forge helps you brainstorm project ideas that match your skills and the tools you're exploring.

## How to Use Project Ideation
1. **Tell Forge your interests**: Share what excites you in the chat
2. **Get project suggestions**: Forge generates project ideas using the tools in your weekly list
3. **Pick a scope**: Choose a project you can complete in your available weekly hours
4. **Track progress**: Use the tracker to monitor your project milestones

## Project Frameworks

### The 1-Hour Sprint
Perfect for busy weeks. Pick one tool and complete a single deliverable:
- Create a social media graphic with an AI design tool
- Generate a short video clip with an AI video editor
- Build a single landing page with an AI site builder

### The Weekend Project
Dedicate 3-5 hours to a more ambitious project:
- Design a brand identity using multiple AI tools
- Create a short promotional video from scratch
- Build a multi-page portfolio site

### The 4-Week Challenge
Your main goal for the month. Break it into weekly milestones:
- Week 1: Research and plan
- Week 2: Build the foundation
- Week 3: Refine and iterate
- Week 4: Polish and ship

## Tips
- **Start small**: It's better to finish a tiny project than abandon a big one
- **Combine tools**: Use 2-3 tools together to create something unique
- **Share your work**: Accountability drives progress
