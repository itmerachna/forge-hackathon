## 4-Week Challenge (Advanced)

**Week 1 — Research & Plan:**
Pick a real problem (personal brand, client project, side project). Define scope, audience, deliverables. Explore 2-3 tools that fit.

**Week 2 — Build v1:**
Create a rough first version using your chosen tools. Don't polish — focus on getting something working end-to-end.

**Week 3 — Iterate:**
Get feedback (from Forge, friends, or online). Improve based on feedback. Try combining a second tool for a specific piece.

**Week 4 — Ship:**
Polish the final version. Write a short post about what you built and what you learned. Submit as proof in Forge.
