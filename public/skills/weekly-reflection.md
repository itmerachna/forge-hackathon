# Weekly Reflection

## Overview
Every week, Forge guides you through a reflection on your learning journey. This helps you consolidate knowledge, celebrate wins, and set intentions for the next week.

## Reflection Prompts
At the end of each week, Forge will ask you:

1. **What tools did you explore this week?**
   - Which ones surprised you? Which ones weren't a good fit?

2. **What did you create or accomplish?**
   - Even small wins count — document them all

3. **What challenges did you face?**
   - Technical blockers, time constraints, creative blocks

4. **What's your key takeaway?**
   - One insight or lesson from this week's exploration

5. **What's your intention for next week?**
   - Set one specific, achievable goal

## Why Reflection Matters
- **Retention**: Writing about what you learned helps you remember it
- **Pattern Recognition**: Over time, you'll see what types of tools resonate with you
- **Momentum**: Acknowledging progress keeps you motivated
- **Direction**: Regular check-ins prevent aimless tool-hopping

## AI Insights
After your reflection, Forge provides:
- A summary of your week's activity
- Patterns it noticed in your learning style
- Suggestions for tools that align with your emerging interests
- Encouragement tied to your 4-week goal

## Building the Habit
- **Set a recurring time**: Friday afternoon or Sunday evening work well
- **Keep it brief**: 5-10 minutes is enough
- **Be honest**: The reflection is for you — no need to sugarcoat
- **Review past reflections**: Monthly lookbacks reveal growth you might not notice day-to-day
